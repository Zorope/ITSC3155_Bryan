# # Part A. starts_with_non_number
# Define a function starts_with_non_number(s) that takes a string and returns true
# if it starts with anything that isn't a number and false otherwise.

# # Part B. multiple_words
# Define a function multiple_words(s) that takes a string and returns true
# if it contains multiple words and false otherwise.

  return


# Part C. reserved_us_tld
# define a method reserved_us_tld(s) that takes a string and returns true
# if the string represents a URL that uses one of the top level domains (TLD) controlled
# by the US government. The three that we care about for this instance are .gov, .edu, and .mil.
# We also want to make sure that we are using a secure connection, so it should start with https
# Note: URLs will be in the format http://www.example.com. There will not be anything after the TLD
# Hint: the URL should start with https and end with one of the TLDs
